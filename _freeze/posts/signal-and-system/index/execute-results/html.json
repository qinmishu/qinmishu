I don't have Matlab, but I may use Scilab/Octave/Python/Julia/R/Haskell instead when necessary. \n\n# reference\n\n[latex cheetsheet](https://quickref.me/latex)\n\n# 1 Basic Concepts \n\nSignal: x(t), function of time, simplified definition. \n\nSystem: A collection of devices that operate on input signal x(t) and produce output signal y(t). \n\nContinuous time signal: takes a value at every instant of time. \n\nDiscrete time signal: is only defined at particular instant of time. \n\nPeriodic vs nonperiodic signals \n\nAnalog vs digital signals \n\nADC: Analog to Digital Converter \n\nFor continuous signal x(t), the normalized energy E of x(t) is (assuming x(t) is real)\n\n$$\nE = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} x(t)^2 dt \n$$\n\nThe normalized power P is \n\n$$\nP = \\lim\\limits_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{+T/2} x(t)^2 dt \n$$\n\nIf x(t) is complex valued \n\n$$\nE = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\vert x(t) \\vert ^2 dt \n$$\n\nThe normalized power P is \n\n$$\nP = \\lim\\limits_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{+T/2} \\vert x(t) \\vert ^2 dt \n$$\n\nFor discrete time signal x[n] \n\n$$\nE = \\sum_{n = -\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\vert x[n] \\vert ^2 \n$$\n\nThe normalized power P \n\n$$\nP = \\lim\\limits_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2N+1} \\sum_{n = -N}^{+N} \\vert x[n] \\vert ^2 \n$$\n\nEnergy signal: $0<E<\\infty$\n\nPower signal: $0<P<\\infty$ \n\nEven vs Odd signal \n\nAny signal can be represented as sum of even and odd signals \n\n$$ \n\\begin{align}\nx(t) = x_e(t) + x_o(t) \\\\\nx_e(t) = \\frac{1}{2} ( x(t) + x(-t) ) \\\\\nx_o(t) = \\frac{1}{2} ( x(t) - x(-t) ) \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n## 1.4 basic continuous time signals \n\nUnit step function u(t) \n\n$$\nu(t) = \\begin{cases}\n   1 &\\text{t > 0} \\\\\n   0 &\\text{t < 0}   \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nUnit impulse function $\\delta(t)$ \n\n$$\n\\delta(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}u(t) = \\begin{cases}\n   0 & t \\ne 0 \\\\\n   \\text{undefined} & t = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe impulse function has the property(called sampling or sifting property)  \n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(t) \\delta(t-t_0)  dt = \\int_{a}^{b} f(t_0) \\delta(t-t_0) dt = f(t_0) \\int_{a}^{b} \\delta(t-t_0) dt = f(t_0) \n$$\n\nUnit ramp function \n\n$$\nr(t) = t \\times u(t)\n$$\n\nUnit rectangle pulse function \n\nUnit triangular pulse function \n\nsinusoidal signal \n\nexponential signal \n\n## 1.5 basic discrete time signals \nUnit step sequence \n\n$$\nu(n) = \\begin{cases}\n   0 &\\text{n < 0} \\\\\n   1 & n \\ge 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nUnit impulse sequence \n\n$$\n\\delta(n) = \\begin{cases}\n   0 & n \\ne 0 \\\\\n   1 & n = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nUnit ramp sequence \n\n$$\nr(n) = \\begin{cases}\n   0 & n < 0 \\\\\n   n & n \\ge 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSinusoidal sequence \n\nExponential sequence \n\n## 1.6 Basic operations on signals \n\nTime reversal \n\nTime scaling \n\nTime shifting \n\nAmplitude transformation \n\n## 1.7 Classifications of systems \n\ncontinuous time vs discrete time systems \n\ncausal vs noncausal systems: A causal system is one whose output y(t) at present time  depends only on the present and past values(not future) of the input x(t). \n\nlinear and nonlinear systems: Linearity is the property of the system describing a linear relationship between input (cause) and output (effect). The property is a combination of both homogeneity(scaling) property and the additivity property. The homogeneity property requires that if the input is multiplied by any constant k, then the output is multiplied by the same constant. The additivity property requires that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately.\n\n$$ \nT \\lbrace k_1 x_1 + k_2 x_2 \\rbrace = k_1 y_1 + k_2 y_2 \n$$\n\ntime varying and time invariant systems: A time-varying system is one whose parameters vary with time. In a time-invariant system, a time shift (advance or delay) in the input signal leads to the time shift in the output signal. \n\nsystems with and without memory: When the output of a system depends on the past and/or future input, the system is said to have a memory. A memoryless system is one in which the current output depends only on the current input; it does not depend on the past or future inputs.A system with a memory is also called a dynamic system. A memoryless system is called a static system.\n\n# 2 Convolution \n\n",
