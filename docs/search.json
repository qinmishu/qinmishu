    "text": "09-函数\n以下内容为学习https://thinkingeek.com/2013/02/02/arm-assembler-raspberry-pi-chapter-9/的摘录.\nFunctions are a way to reuse code.\nAAPCS:Procedure Call Standard for ARM Architecture\n\n\n\nRegister\nRegister Alias\nDescription\nRemark\n\n\n\n\nr15\npc\nProgram Counter\n\n\n\nr14\nlr\nLink Register\n\n\n\nr13\nsp\nStack Pointer\n\n\n\n\ncpsr\nCurrent Program Status Register\n\n\n\n\nFunctions can receive parameters. The first 4 parameters must be stored, sequentially, in the registers r0, r1, r2 and r3.\n\nWell behaved functions\nA function must adhere, at least, to the following rules if we want it to be AAPCS compliant.\n\nA function should not make any assumption on the contents of the cpsr. So, at the entry of a function condition codes N, Z, C and V are unknown.\nA function can freely modify registers r0, r1, r2 and r3.\nA function cannot assume anything on the contents of r0, r1, r2 and r3 unless they are playing the role of a parameter.\nA function can freely modify lr but the value upon entering the function will be needed when leaving the function (so such value must be kept somewhere).\nA function can modify all the remaining registers as long as their values are restored upon leaving the function. This includes sp and registers r4 to r11.\nThis means that, after calling a function, we have to assume that (only) registers r0, r1, r2, r3 and lr have been overwritten.\n\n\n\nCalling a function\ndirect call:\nbl label\nindirect call(first storing the address of the function into a register):\nblx Rsource1 /* Rsource1 means register operand1 */\nIn both cases the behaviour is as follows: the address of the function (immediately encoded in the bl or using the value of the register in blx) is stored in pc. The address of the instruction following the bl or blx instruction is kept in lr.\n\n\nLeaving a function\nA well behaved function, as stated above, will have to keep the initial value of lr somewhere. When leaving the function, we will retrieve that value and put it in some register (it can be lr again but this is not mandatory). Then we will bx Rsource1 (we could use blx as well but the latter would update lr which is useless here).\n\n\nReturning data from functions\nFunctions must use r0 for data that fits in 32 bit (or less). This is, C types char, short, int, long (and float though we have not seen floating point yet) will be returned in r0. For basic types of 64 bit, like C types long long and double, they will be returned in r1 and r0. Any other data is returned through the stack unless it is 32 bit or less, where it will be returned in r0.\n\n\nHello world (puts)\n/* -- hello01.s */\n.data\n\ngreeting:\n .asciz \"Hello world\"\n\n.balign 4\nreturn: .word 0\n\n.text\n\n.global main\nmain:\n    ldr r1, address_of_return     /*   r1 ← &address_of_return */\n    str lr, [r1]                  /*   *r1 ← lr */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_greeting   /* r0 ← &address_of_greeting */\n                                  /* First parameter of puts */\n\n    bl puts                       /* Call to puts */\n                                  /* lr ← address of next instruction */\n\n    ldr r1, address_of_return     /* r1 ← &address_of_return */\n    ldr lr, [r1]                  /* lr ← *r1 */\n    bx lr                         /* return from main */\naddress_of_greeting: .word greeting\naddress_of_return: .word return\n\n/* External */\n.global puts\n\n\nInteraction (scanf, printf)\n/* -- printf01.s */\n.data\n\n/* First message */\n.balign 4\nmessage1: .asciz \"Hey, type a number: \"\n\n/* Second message */\n.balign 4\nmessage2: .asciz \"I read the number %d\\n\"\n\n/* Format pattern for scanf */\n.balign 4\nscan_pattern : .asciz \"%d\"\n\n/* Where scanf will store the number read */\n.balign 4\nnumber_read: .word 0\n\n.balign 4\nreturn: .word 0\n\n.text\n\n.global main\nmain:\n    ldr r1, address_of_return        /* r1 ← &address_of_return */\n    str lr, [r1]                     /* *r1 ← lr */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_message1      /* r0 ← &message1 */\n    bl printf                        /* call to printf */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_scan_pattern  /* r0 ← &scan_pattern */\n    ldr r1, address_of_number_read   /* r1 ← &number_read */\n    bl scanf                         /* call to scanf */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_message2      /* r0 ← &message2 */\n    ldr r1, address_of_number_read   /* r1 ← &number_read */\n    ldr r1, [r1]                     /* r1 ← *r1 */\n    bl printf                        /* call to printf */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_number_read   /* r0 ← &number_read */\n    ldr r0, [r0]                     /* r0 ← *r0 */\n\n    ldr lr, address_of_return        /* lr ← &address_of_return */\n    ldr lr, [lr]                     /* lr ← *lr */\n    bx lr                            /* return from main using lr */\naddress_of_message1 : .word message1\naddress_of_message2 : .word message2\naddress_of_scan_pattern : .word scan_pattern\naddress_of_number_read : .word number_read\naddress_of_return : .word return\n\n/* External */\n.global printf\n.global scanf\n\n\nFirst function (multiply by 5)\n/* -- printf02.s */\n.data\n\n/* First message */\n.balign 4\nmessage1: .asciz \"Hey, type a number: \"\n\n/* Second message */\n.balign 4\nmessage2: .asciz \"%d times 5 is %d\\n\"\n\n/* Format pattern for scanf */\n.balign 4\nscan_pattern : .asciz \"%d\"\n\n/* Where scanf will store the number read */\n.balign 4\nnumber_read: .word 0\n\n.balign 4\nreturn: .word 0\n\n.balign 4\nreturn2: .word 0\n\n.text\n\n/*\nmult_by_5 function\n*/\nmult_by_5: \n    ldr r1, address_of_return2       /* r1 ← &address_of_return */\n    str lr, [r1]                     /* *r1 ← lr */\n\n    add r0, r0, r0, LSL #2           /* r0 ← r0 + 4*r0 */\n\n    ldr lr, address_of_return2       /* lr ← &address_of_return */\n    ldr lr, [lr]                     /* lr ← *lr */\n    bx lr                            /* return from main using lr */\naddress_of_return2 : .word return2\n\n.global main\nmain:\n    ldr r1, address_of_return        /* r1 ← &address_of_return */\n    str lr, [r1]                     /* *r1 ← lr */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_message1      /* r0 ← &message1 */\n    bl printf                        /* call to printf */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_scan_pattern  /* r0 ← &scan_pattern */\n    ldr r1, address_of_number_read   /* r1 ← &number_read */\n    bl scanf                         /* call to scanf */\n\n    ldr r0, address_of_number_read   /* r0 ← &number_read */\n    ldr r0, [r0]                     /* r0 ← *r0 */\n    bl mult_by_5\n\n    mov r2, r0                       /* r2 ← r0 */\n    ldr r1, address_of_number_read   /* r1 ← &number_read */\n    ldr r1, [r1]                     /* r1 ← *r1 */\n    ldr r0, address_of_message2      /* r0 ← &message2 */\n    bl printf                        /* call to printf */\n\n    ldr lr, address_of_return        /* lr ← &address_of_return */\n    ldr lr, [lr]                     /* lr ← *lr */\n    bx lr                            /* return from main using lr */\naddress_of_message1 : .word message1\naddress_of_message2 : .word message2\naddress_of_scan_pattern : .word scan_pattern\naddress_of_number_read : .word number_read\naddress_of_return : .word return\n\n/* External */\n.global printf\n.global scanf"

The property is a combination of both homogeneity(scaling) property and the additivity property. The homogeneity property requires that if the input is multiplied by any constant k, then the output is multiplied by the same constant. The additivity property requires that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately.\n\\[\nT \\lbrace k_1 x_1 + k_2 x_2 \\rbrace = k_1 y_1 + k_2 y_2\n\\]\ntime varying and time invariant systems: A time-varying system is one whose parameters vary with time.

A memoryless system is one in which the current output depends only on the current input; it does not depend on the past or future inputs.A system with a memory is also called a dynamic system.

    "text": "10 Functions. The stack\n// stm -- store multiple, i -- increase, a -- after, d -- decrease, b -- before \nstmia, stmib, stmda, stmdb, ldmia, ldmib, ldmda, ldmdb \n\n// push is equivalent to stmdb, pop is equivalent to ldmia when operating on sp \npush, pop\n\n// multiplication instruction \nmul Rdest, Rsource1, Rsource2.\n\nDynamic activation\nOne of the benefits of functions is being able to call them more than once. A function may call itself.\nA function is dynamically activated each time it is called. The span of a dynamic activation goes from the point where the function is called until it returns. At a given time, more than one function is dynamically activated. The whole dynamic activation set of functions includes the current function and the dynamic activation set of the function that called it (the current function).\n//Example recursive function that calls itself \nint factorial(int n)\n{\n   if (n == 0)\n      return 1;\n   else\n      return n * factorial(n-1);\n}\nWell behaved functions(Refer to Chap9), a brief recall:\n\nOnly r0, r1, r2 and r3 can be freely modified.\nlr(r14) value at the entry of the function must be kept somewhere because we will need it to leave the function (to return to the caller).\nAll other registers r4 to r11 and sp(r13) can be modified but they must be restored to their original values upon leaving the function.\n\nNote: pc register is r15. TBD: What’s the function of r12 function? Why is it not mentioned here?\nwe need some way to keep at least the value of lr per each dynamic activation. And not only lr, if we wanted to use registers from r4 to r11 we also need to keep somehow per each dynamic activation, a global variable would not be enough either. This is where the stack comes into play.\n\n\nThe stack\nIn computing, a stack is a data structure (a way to organize data that provides some interesting properties). A stack typically has three operations: access the top of the stack, push onto the top, pop from the top. Dependening on the context you can only access the top of the stack, in our case we will be able to access more elements than just the top.\nBut, what is the stack? I already said in chaper 9 that the stack is a region of memory owned solely by the function. We can now reword this a bit better: the stack is a region of memory owned solely by the current dynamic activation. register sp stands for stack pointer. This register will contain the top of the stack. The region of memory owned by the dynamic activation is the extent of bytes contained between the current value of sp and the initial value that sp had at the beginning of the function. We will call that region the local memory of a function (more precisely, of a dynamic activation of it). We will put there whatever has to be saved at the beginning of a function and restored before leaving. We will also keep there the local variables of a function (dynamic activation).\nOur function also has to adhere to some rules when handling the stack.\n\nThe stack pointer (sp) is always 4 byte aligned. This is absolutely mandatory. However, due to the Procedure Call Standard for the ARM architecture (AAPCS), the stack pointer will have to be 8 byte aligned, otherwise funny things may happen when we call what the AAPCS calls as public interfaces (this is, code written by other people). (Note: It means we can persist in 4 byte aligned if the function we are written is only called by ourself, and we won’t call functions written by other persons; otherwise, we should persist in 8 byte algined.)\n\nThe value of sp when leaving the function should be the same value it had upon entering the function.\n\nIt is a convention how the stack, and thus the local memory, has its size defined. The stack can grow upwards or downwards. If it grows upwards it means that we have to increase the value of the sp register in order to enlarge the local memory. If it grows downwards we have to do the opposite, the value of the sp register must be subtracted as many bytes as the size of the local storage. In Linux ARM, the stack grows downwards, towards zero (although it never should reach zero). Addresses of local variables have very large values in the 32 bit range. They are usually close to \\(2^{32}\\).\nAnother convention when using the stack concerns whether the sp register contains the address of the top of the stack or some bytes above. In Linux ARM the sp register directly points to the top of the stack: in the memory addressed by sp there is useful information.\nExample snippets of keep lr register and restore lr register. (Note: We can use add and sub to operate sp, we may also use push and pop or stmxx and ldmxx instructions.)\nsub sp, sp, #8  /* sp ← sp - 8. This enlarges the stack by 8 bytes */\nstr lr, [sp]    /* *sp ← lr */\n... // Code of the function\nldr lr, [sp]    /* lr ← *sp */\nadd sp, sp, #8  /* sp ← sp + 8. /* This reduces the stack by 8 bytes\n                                effectively restoring the stack \n                                pointer to its original value */\nbx lr\nShortened snippets of keep lr and restore lr, making use of indexing modes.\nstr lr, [sp, #-8]!  /* preindex: sp ← sp - 8; *sp ← lr */\n... // Code of the function\nldr lr, [sp], #+8   /* postindex; lr ← *sp; sp ← sp + 8 */\nbx lr\n\n\nFirst approach to implement the factorial function\nIt uses the mul Rdest, Rsource1, Rsource2 instruction.\nThis instruction only computes the lower 32 bits. Because we are not going to use 64 bit values in this example, the maximum factorial we will be able to compute is 12! (13! is bigger than \\(2^{32}\\)).\nThis approach directly operates on the sp register.\n/* -- factorial01.s */\n.data\n\nmessage1: .asciz \"Type a number: \"\nformat:   .asciz \"%d\"\nmessage2: .asciz \"The factorial of %d is %d\\n\"\n\n.text\n\nfactorial:\n    str lr, [sp,#-4]!  /* Push lr onto the top of the stack */\n    str r0, [sp,#-4]!  /* Push r0 onto the top of the stack */\n                       /* Note that after that, sp is 8 byte aligned */\n    cmp r0, #0         /* compare r0 and 0 */\n    bne is_nonzero     /* if r0 != 0 then branch */\n    mov r0, #1         /* r0 ← 1.

Since ARM was designed for embedded systems, ARM designers devised a way to reduce the number of instructions we need for the «bookkeeping» of the stack. These instructions are load multiple, ldm, and store multiple, stm.\nThese two instructions are rather powerful and allow in a single instruction perform a lot of things. Their syntax is shown as follows. Elements enclosed in curly braces { and } may be omitted from the syntax (the effect of the instruction will vary, though).\nldm addressing-mode Rbase{!}, register-set\nstm addressing-mode Rbase{!}, register-set\nWe will consider addressing-mode later. Rbase is the base address used to load to or store from the register-set. All 16 ARM registers may be specified in register-set (except pc in stm). A set of addresses is generated when executing these instructions. One address per register in the register-set. Then, each register, in ascending order, is paired with each of these addresses, also in ascending order. This way the lowest-numbered register gets the lowest memory address, and the highest-numbered register gets the highest memory address. Each pair register-address is then used to perform the memory operation: load or store. Specifying ! means that Rbase will be updated. The updated value depends on addressing-mode.\nNote that, if the registers are paired with addresses depending on their register number, it seems that they will always be loaded and stored in the same way. For instance a register-set containing r4, r5 and r6 will always store r4 in the lowest address generated by the instruction and r6 in the highest one(Note: Since it is a set, the order does not matter. r4, r5, r6 and r4, r6, r5 mean the same thing in a set). We can, though, specify what is considered the lowest address or the highest address. So, is Rbase actually the highest address or the lowest address of the multiple load/store? This is one of the two aspects that is controlled by addressing-mode. The second aspect relates to when the address of the memory operation changes between each memory operation.\nIf the value in Rbase is to be considered the the highest address it means that we should first decrease Rbase as many bytes as required by the number of registers in the register-set (this is 4 times the number of registers) to form the lowest address. Then we can load or store each register consecutively starting from that lowest address, always in ascending order of the register number. This addressing mode is called decreasing and is specified using a d. Conversely, if Rbase is to be considered the lowest address, then this is a bit easier as we can use its value as the lowest address already. We proceed as usual, loading or storing each register in ascending order of their register number. This addressing mode is called increasing and is specified using an i.\nAt each load or store, the address generated for the memory operation may be updated after or before the memory operation itself. We can specify this using a or b, respectively.\nIf we specify !, after the instruction, Rbase will have the highest address generated in the increasing mode and the lowest address generated in the decreasing mode. The final value of Rbase will include the final addition or subtraction if we use a mode that updates after (an a mode).\nSo we have four addressing modes, namely: ia, ib, da and db. These addressing modes are specified as suffixes of the stm and ldm instructions. So the full set of names is stmia, stmib, stmda, stmdb, ldmia, ldmib, ldmda, ldmdb. Now you may think that this is overly complicated, but we need not use all the eight modes. Only two of them are of interest to us now.\nWhen we push something onto the stack we actually decrease the stack pointer (because in Linux the stack grows downwards). More precisely, we first decrease the stack pointer as many bytes as needed before doing the actual store on that just computed stack pointer. So the appropiate addressing-mode when pushing onto the stack is stmdb. Conversely when popping from the stack we will use ldmia: we increment the stack pointer after we have performed the load.\n\n\nFactorial again using stm or push and ldm or pop\nBefore illustrating these two instructions, we will first slightly rewrite our factorial.\nIf you go back to the code of our factorial, there is a moment, when computing n * factorial(n-1), where the initial value of r0 is required. The value of n was in r0 at the beginning of the function, but r0 can be freely modified by called functions.\nIn our second version of factorial, we will keep a copy of the initial value of r0 into r4. But r4 is a register the value of which must be restored upon leaving a function. So we will keep the value of r4 at the entry of the function in the stack. At the end we will restore it back from the stack. This way we can use r4 without breaking the rules of well-behaved functions.\nfactorial:\n    str lr, [sp,#-4]!  /* Push lr onto the top of the stack */\n    str r4, [sp,#-4]!  /* Push r4 onto the top of the stack */\n                       /* The stack is now 8 byte aligned */\n    mov r4, r0         /* Keep a copy of the initial value of r0 in r4 */\n\n\n    cmp r0, #0         /* compare r0 and 0 */\n    bne is_nonzero     /* if r0 != 0 then branch */\n    mov r0, #1         /* r0 ← 1.

GNU assembler will emit a warning otherwise. Since lr is actually r14 it must go after r4. This means that our code is 100% equivalent to the previous one since r4 will end in a lower address than lr: remember our stack grows toward lower addresses, thus r4 which is in the top of the stack in factorial has the lowest address.\nRemembering stmdb sp! and ldmia sp! may be a bit hard. Also, given that these two instructions will be relatively common when entering and leaving functions, GNU assembler provides two mnemonics push and pop for stmdb sp! and ldmia sp!, respectively. Note that these are not ARM instructions actually, just convenience names that are easier to remember.\nThe above program can be improved via push and pop as below:\nfactorial:\n    push {r4, lr} /* Push r4 and lr onto the stack */\n     \n                       /* The stack is now 8 byte aligned */\n    mov r4, r0         /* Keep a copy of the initial value of r0 in r4 */\n\n\n    cmp r0, #0         /* compare r0 and 0 */\n    bne is_nonzero     /* if r0 != 0 then branch */\n    mov r0, #1         /* r0 ← 1. This is the return */\n    b end\nis_nonzero:\n                       /* Prepare the call to factorial(n-1) */\n    sub r0, r0, #1     /* r0 ← r0 - 1 */\n    bl factorial\n                       /* After the call r0 contains factorial(n-1) */\n                       /* Load initial value of r0 (that we kept in r4) into r1 */\n    mov r1, r4         /* r1 ← r4 */\n    mul r0, r0, r1     /* r0 ← r0 * r1 */\n\nend:\n    pop {r4, lr}    /* Pop lr and r4 from the stack */\n    bx lr              /* Leave factorial */"

    "section": "Chap4 Location: Registers, Memory Addressing, and Knowing Where Things Are",
    "text": "Chap4 Location: Registers, Memory Addressing, and Knowing Where Things Are\nThe skill of assembly language consists of a deep comprehension of memory addressing. Everything else is details – and easy details, at that.\nThere are a fair number of different ways to address memory in the Intel/AMD CPU family. Each of these ways is called a Memory Model. There are 3 major memory models that you can use with the more recent members of the Intel family, and a number of minor variations on those three, especially the one in the middle.\nReal mode flat model.\nReal mode segmented model.\nProtected-mode flat model(32-bit and 64-bit).\nThe 8080 was an 8-bit CPU(its general-purpose registers have 8-bits), meaning that it processed 8 bits of information at a time. However, it had 16 address lines coming out of it(it will address 64KB).\nThe 8080 memory-addressing scheme was very simple. You put a 16-bit address out on the address lines, and you got back the 8-bit value that was stored at that address.\nThe 8086 comes after 8080. It is 16-bit CPU. It has 20 address lines.\nThe 8080 is used a lot. Intel wanted to make it easy for people to translate older software from the 8080 to 8086. One way to do this was to make sure that a 16-bit addressing system such as that of the 8080 still worked. Even though the 8086 could address 16 times as much memory as the 8080(16x64KB=1MB), Intel setup the 8086 so that a program could take some 64 KB segment within that megabyte of memory and run entirely inside it, just as though it were the smaller 8080 memory system. This was done by the use of segment registers.\nSpeaking of the 8086 and 8088, there are 4 segment registers(CS, DS, …).\nThis was very wise short-term thinking and catastrophically bad long-term thinking. Programs that needed more than 64KB of memory at a time had to use memory in 64KB chunks, switching between chunks by switching values into and out of segment registers.\nTo maintain backward compatibility with the ancient 8086 and 8088, newer CPUs were given the power to limit themselves to what the older chips could address and execute. When a Pentium-class or better CPU needs to run software written for the real-mode segmented model, it pulls a neat trick that, temporarily, make it become an 8086. This was called virtual-86 mode, and it provided excellent backward compatibility for DOS software.\nA segment may start every 16 bytes throughout the full megabyte of real memory.\nCS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS: Segment registers. All segment registers are 16 bits in size, irrespective of the CPU. FS and GS exist only in the 386 and later Intel x86 32-bit CPUs.\nCS: Code Segment\nDS: Data Segment\nSS: Stack Segment\nES: Extra segment\nFS, GS: Clones of ES\nSegment registers become useless in application programming in X86-64. Operating systems use two of them for special purposes.\nDo Intel’s x86-64 CPUs have 64 address lines? No (48 or 52).\nIn the x86-64 world, CPUs have 14 general purpose 64-bit registers, plus SP and BP.\nThere are eight 16-bit general-purpose registers: AX, BX, CX, DX, BP, SI, DI, SP (8086, 8088, 80186 and 80286).\nEAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI, ESP. (32 bitS)\nRAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RBP, RSI, RDI, RSP. R8 to R15. (64 BITS)\nRAX(EAX(AX(AH,AL)))\nRBX(EBX(BX(BH,BL)))\nRCX(ECX(CX(CH,CL)))\nRDX(EDX(DX(DH,DL)))\nRSI(ESI(SI(SIL))) and so on for RDI, RSP.\nRIP, EIP, IP\nThe new x64 registers R8-R15 can be addressed as 64 bits, 32 bits, 16 bits, and 8 bits. However, the AH/AL scheme for the low 16 bits is a trick reserved for only RAX-RDX. The naming scheme for the R registers provides a mnemonic: D for double word, W for word, and B for byte. For example, if you want to deal with the lowest 8 bits of R8, you use the name R8B. Don’t make the beginner’s mistake of assuming that R8, R8D, R8W, and R8B are four separate and independent registers! A better metaphor is to think of the register names as country/state/county/city.\nIP register.\nWhile executing a program, the CPU uses IP to keep track of where it is in the current code segment. Instructions come in different sizes, ranging typically from 1 to 15 bytes. The CPU knows the size of each instruction it executes.\nIP is notable in being the only register that can neither be read nor written to directly.\nFlags register.\nRFLAGS, EFLAGS, FLAGS. When the flag’s value is 1, we say that the flag is set. When the flag’s value is 0, we say that the flag is cleared.\nMath Coprocessors and Their Registers (may be 128 bits or 256 bits)\nReal-Mode Flat Model\nReal-Mode Segmented Model\n32-bit Protected Mode Flat Model\n64-bit Long Mode"

    "text": "Chap5 The Right to Assemble: The Process of Creating Assembly Language Programs\nText files: are files that can be opened and examined meaningfully in a text editor, like notepad.\nBinary files: are files containing values that do not display meaningfully as text.\nAssemblers: read your source code files and generate an object code file containing the machine instructions that the CPU understands plus any data you’ve defined in your source code.\nLinker: Object code files cannot themselves be run as programs. An additional step, called linking, is necessary to turn object code files into executable program files.\nSymbol table: To process several object modules into a single executable module, the linker must first build an index called a symbol table, with an entry for every named item in every object module it links, with information on what name (called a symbol) refers to what location within the module.\nExe: Once the symbol table is complete, the linker builds an image of how the executable program will be arranged in memory when the operating system loads it. This image is then to disk as the executable file. The most important thing about the image that the linker builds relates to addresses.\nHoles: Object modules are allowed to refer to symbols in other object modules. During assembly, these external references are left as holes to be filled later—naturally enough, because the module in which these external symbolsexist may not have been assembled or even written yet. As the linker builds animage of the eventual executable program file, it learns where all of the symbols are located within the image and thus can drop real addresses into all of the external reference holes.\nDebugging info: Debugging information is, in a sense, a step backward. Portions of the source code, which was all stripped out early in the assembly process, are put back into the object module by the assembler. These portions of the source code are mostly the names of data items and procedures, and they’re embedded in the object file to make it easier for the programmer (you!) to see the names of data items when you debug the program.\nRelocatability: Primordial microcomputers like 8080 systems running CP/M-80 had a simple memory architecture. Programs were written to be loaded and run at a specific physical memory address. For CP/M, this was 0100H. The programmer could assume that any program would start at 0100H and go up from there. Memory addresses of data items and procedures were actual physical addresses, and every time the program ran, its data items were loaded and referenced at precisely the same place in memory. This all changed with the arrival of the 8086, and 8086-specific operating systems such as CP/M-86 and PC DOS. Improvements in the Intel architecture introduced with the 8086 made it unnecessary for the program to be assembled for running at any specific physical memory address. This feature is called relocatability and is a necessary part of any modern operating system, especially when multiple programs may be running at once.\nThe author uses nasm. To compile an ASM file.

    "text": "The 64 bit x86 C Calling Convention\nThe section is copied from x86-64 call convention. It is for Linux. Microsoft windows does not follow the same convention. Refer to x64 calling convention, Microsoft.\npop, push, call, ret instructions.\nThe caller’s rules:\n\nBefore calling a subroutine, the caller should save the contents of certain registers that are designated caller-saved. The caller-saved registers are r10, r11, and any registers that parameters are put into. If you want the contents of these registers to be preserved across the subroutine call, push them onto the stack.\nTo pass parameters to the subroutine, we put up to six of them into registers (in order: rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9). If there are more than six parameters to the subroutine, then push the rest onto the stack in reverse order (i.e. last parameter first) – since the stack grows down, the first of the extra parameters (really the seventh parameter) parameter will be stored at the lowest address (this inversion of parameters was historically used to allow functions to be passed a variable number of parameters).\nTo call the subroutine, use the call instruction. This instruction places the return address on top of the parameters on the stack, and branches to the subroutine code.\nAfter the subroutine returns, (i.e. immediately following the call instruction) the caller must remove any additional parameters (beyond the six stored in registers) from stack. This restores the stack to its state before the call was performed.\nThe caller can expect to find the return value of the subroutine in the register RAX.\nThe caller restores the contents of caller-saved registers (r10, r11, and any in the parameter passing registers) by popping them off of the stack. The caller can assume that no other registers were modified by the subroutine.\n\nThe Callee’s Rules:\n\nAllocate local variables by using registers or making space on the stack. Recall, the stack grows down, so to make space on the top of the stack, the stack pointer should be decremented. The amount by which the stack pointer is decremented depends on the number of local variables needed. For example, if a local float and a local long (12 bytes total) were required, the stack pointer would need to be decremented by 12 to make space for these local variables: sub rsp, 12. As with parameters, local variables will be located at known offsets from the stack pointer.\nNext, the values of any registers that are designated callee-saved that will be used by the function must be saved. To save registers, push them onto the stack. The callee-saved registers are RBX, RBP, and R12 through R15 (RSP will also be preserved by the call convention, but need not be pushed on the stack during this step). After these three actions are performed, the actual operation of the subroutine may proceed. When the subroutine is ready to return, the call convention rules continue.\nWhen the function is done, the return value for the function should be placed in RAX if it is not already there.\nThe function must restore the old values of any callee-saved registers (RBX, RBP, and R12 through R15) that were modified. The register contents are restored by popping them from the stack. Note, the registers should be popped in the inverse order that they were pushed.\nNext, we deallocate local variables. The easiest way to do this is to add to RSP the same amount that was subtracted from it in step 1.\nFinally, we return to the caller by executing a ret instruction. This instruction will find and remove the appropriate return address from the stack.\n\nIf you look at the assembly generated by some compilers, you will see a few extra commands in there in the callee’s prologue:\npush rbp ; at the start of the callee \nmov rbp, rsp\n... \npop rbp ; just before the ending `ret` \nThis code is unnecessary, and is a hold-over from the 32-bit calling convention. You can tell the compiler to not include this code by invoking it with the -fomit-frame-pointer flag.\nIt might be noted that the callee’s rules fall cleanly into two halves that are basically mirror images of one another. The first half of the rules apply to the beginning of the function, and are therefor commonly said to define the prologue to the function. The latter half of the rules apply to the end of the function, and are thus commonly said to define the epilogue of the function."

    "text": "The 32 bit x86 C calling Convention\nThe section is copied from x86 32 bit call convention.\nThe Caller’s Rules\n\nBfore calling a subroutine, the caller should save the contents of certain registers that are designated caller-saved. The caller-saved registers are EAX, ECX, EDX. If you want the contents of these registers to be preserved across the subroutine call, push them onto the stack\nTo pass parameters to the subroutine, push them onto the stack before the call. The parameters should be pushed in inverted order (i.e. last parameter first) – since the stack grows down, the first parameter will be stored at the lowest address (this inversion of parameters was historically used to allow functions to be passed a variable number of parameters).\nTo call the subroutine, use the call instruction. This instruction places the return address on top of the parameters on the stack, and branches to the subroutine code.\nAfter the subroutine returns, (i.e. immediately following the call instruction) the caller must remove the parameters from stack. This restores the stack to its state before the call was performed.\nThe caller can expect to find the return value of the subroutine in the register EAX.\nThe caller restores the contents of caller-saved registers (EAX, ECX, EDX) by popping them off of the stack. The caller can assume that no other registers were modified by the subroutine.\n\nThe Callee’s Rules\n\nAt the beginning of the subroutine, the function should push the value of EBP onto the stack, and then copy the value of ESP into EBP using the following instructions:\n\npush ebp \nmov ebp, esp ;Intel style instead of AT&T style \nThe reason for this initial action is the maintenance of the base pointer, EBP. The base pointer is used by convention as a point of reference for finding parameters and local variables on the stack. Essentially, when any subroutine is executing, the base pointer is a “snapshot” of the stack pointer value from when the subroutine started executing. Parameters and local variables will always be located at known, constant offsets away from the base pointer value. We push the old base pointer value at the beginning of the subroutine so that we can later restore the appropriate base pointer value for the caller when the subroutine returns. Remember, the caller isn’t expecting the subroutine to change the value of the base pointer. We then move the stack pointer into EBP to obtain our point of reference for accessing parameters and local variables.\n\nNext, allocate local variables by making space on the stack. Recall, the stack grows down, so to make space on the top of the stack, the stack pointer should be decremented. The amount by which the stack pointer is decremented depends on the number of local variables needed. For example, if 3 local integers (4 bytes each) were required, the stack pointer would need to be decremented by 12 to make space for these local variables. I.e.:\n\nsub esp, 12 \nAs with parameters, local variables will be located at known offsets from the base pointer.\n\nNext, the values of any registers that are designated callee-saved that will be used by the function must be saved. To save registers, push them onto the stack. The callee-saved registers are EBX, EDI and ESI (ESP and EBP will also be preserved by the call convention, but need not be pushed on the stack during this step). After these three actions are performed, the actual operation of the subroutine may proceed. When the subroutine is ready to return, the call convention rules continue:\nWhen the function is done, the return value for the function should be placed in EAX if it is not already there.\nThe function must restore the old values of any callee-saved registers (EBX, EDI and ESI) that were modified. The register contents are restored by popping them from the stack. Note, the registers should be popped in the inverse order that they were pushed.\nNext, we deallocate local variables. The obvious way to do this might be to add the appropriate value to the stack pointer (since the space was allocated by subtracting the needed amount from the stack pointer). In practice, a less error-prone way to deallocate the variables is to move the value in the base pointer into the stack pointer, i.e.:\n\nmov esp, ebp \nThis trick works because the base pointer always contains the value that the stack pointer contained immediately prior to the allocation of the local variables.\n\nImmediately before returning, we must restore the caller’s base pointer value by popping EBP off the stack. Remember, the first thing we did on entry to the subroutine was to push the base pointer to save its old value.\nFinally, we return to the caller by executing a ret instruction. This instruction will find and remove the appropriate return address from the stack."

    "text": "Chap7 Following your instructions: Meeting Machine Instructions Up Close and Personal\ninstructions: xchg, inc, dec, jnz, jmp, neg, movsx, mul, div, imul, idiv\nImmediate data is built right into its own machine instruction. Register data is stored in one of the CPU’s collection of internal registers. In contrast, memory data is stored somewhere in the silver of system memory “owned” by a program, at a 64-bit memory address.\nOnly one of an instruction’s two operands may specify a memory location. You can’t move a memory value directly to another memory value. This is an inherent limitation of Intel CPUs of all generations.\nTo specify that we want the data at the memory location contained in a register rather than the data in the register itself, we use square brackets around the name of the register.\nmov rax, [rbx]\n\nmov rax, [rbx + 16]\n\nmov rax, [rbx + rcx]\n\nmov rax, [rbx + rcx + 11]\nWhatever is inside the brackets is called the effective address of a data item in memory. At the current evolution of the Intel hardware, 2 registers may be added together to form the effective address, but not three or more.\nWhere the size issue gets tricky is when you write data in a register out to memory. NASM does not “remember” the size of variables, like higher-level languages do. It knows where EatMsg starts in memory, and that’s it. You have to tell NASM how many bytes of data to move. This is done by a size specifier.\nmov byte [EatMsg], 'G'\nHere we tell NASM that we want to move only a single byte out to memory by using the BYTE size specifier. Other size specifiers include WORD, DWORD, QWORD.\nOnly 18 bits of the RFlags register are actually flags. The rest are reserved for later use in future generations of Intel CPUs. Even among the defined flags, only a few are commonplace, and fewer still are useful when you’re just learning your way around. Some are used only inside system software like operating systems and are not available at all in userspace programs.\nOF: Overflow flag. is set when the result of an arithmetic operation on a signed integer quantity becomes too large to fit in the operand it originally occupied. OF is generally used as the “carry flag” in signed arithmetic.\nDF: The Direction flag is an oddball among the flags in that it tells the CPU something that you want it to know, rather than the other way around. It dictates the direction that activity moves (up-memory or down-memory) during the execution of string instructions. When DF is set, string instructions proceed from high memory toward low memory. When DF is cleared, string instructions proceed from low memory toward high memory.\nIF: The Interrupt Enable flag is a two-way flag. The CPU sets it under certain conditions, and you can set it yourself using the STI and CLI instructions—though you probably won’t; see below. When IF is set, interrupts are enabled and may occur when requested. When IF is cleared, interrupts are ignored by the CPU. Ordinary programs could set and clear this flag with impunity in Real Mode, back in the DOS era. Under Linux (whether 32-bit or 64-bit) IF is reserved for the use of the operating system and sometimes its drivers. If you try to use the STI and CLI instructions within one of your programs, Linux will hand you a general protection fault, and your program will be terminated. Consider IF off-limits for userspace programming like we’re discussing in this book.\nTF: When set, the Trap flag allows debuggers to manage single-stepping, by forcing the CPU to execute only a single instruction before calling an interrupt routine. This is not an especially useful flag for ordinary programming, and I won’t have anything more to say about it in this book.\nSF: The Sign flag becomes set when the result of an operation forces the operand to become negative. By negative, we mean only that the highest-order bit in the operand (the sign bit) becomes 1 during a signed arithmetic operation. Any operation that leaves the sign of the result positive will clear SF\nZF: The Zero flag becomes set when the results of an operation become zero. If the destination operand instead becomes some nonzero value, ZF is cleared. You’ll be using this one a lot for conditional jumps.\nAF: The Auxiliary Carry flag. used only for BCD arithmetic. These instructions are considered obsolete and are not present in x64.\nPF: The Parity flag PF indicates whether the number of set (1) bits in the low-order byte of a result is even or odd. For example, if the result is 0F2H, PF will be cleared because 0F2H (11110010) contains an odd number of 1 bits.\nCF: The Carry flag is used in unsigned arithmetic operations. If the result of an arithmetic or shift operation “carries out” a bit from the operand, CF becomes set. Otherwise, if nothing is carried out, CF is cleared.\nThe highest bit in the most significant byte of a signed value is the sign bit. If the sign bit is a 1-bit, the number is negative.\nmovsx: move with sign extension\nxor rax, rax \nmov ax, -42 \nmovsx rbx, ax ;rbx will become -42 in two's complement \nmul instruction has implicit operand. Immediate values cannot be used as operands for mul. MUL very helpfully sets the Carry flag CF when the value of the product overflows the low-order register.\n\n\n\nexplicit operand\nimplicit operand\nimplicit product\n\n\n\n\nmul r/m8\nAL\nAX\n\n\nmul r/m16\nAX\nDX:AX\n\n\nmul r/m32\nEAX\nEDX:EAX\n\n\nmul r/m64\nRAX\nRDX:RAX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexplicit operand\nimplicit operand\nquotient\nremainder\n\n\n\n\ndiv r/m8\nAX\nAL\nAH\n\n\ndiv r/m16\nDX:AX\nAX\nDX\n\n\ndiv r/m32\nEDX:EAX\nEAX\nEDX\n\n\ndiv r/m64\nRDX:RAX\nRAX\nRDX\n\n\n\nNote: r/m8 means 8bits register or memory\nmov eax,447\nmov ebx,1739\nmul ebx"

That means that you don’t have to know the absolute address of something you want to reference, you only need to know how far away it is from the currently executing instruction.\nThere are very few addressing modes which use a full 64bit absolute address. Most addressing modes are 32bit offsets relative to one of the 64bit registers (usually RIP)."

    "section": "Chap8 Creating programs that work",
    "text": "Chap8 Creating programs that work\nOrdinary user-space programs written in NASM for Linux are divided into 3 sections. The order in which these sections fall in your program really isn’t important, but by convention the .data section comes first, followed by the .bass section and then the .text section.\n.data section contains data definitions of initialized data items.\n.bss Block/Buffer Start Symbol. Contains data items not having values before the program begins running.\nData items in the .data section add to the size of your executable file. Data items in the .bss section do not. A buffer that takes up 16,1000 bytes can be defined in .bss and add almost nothing( about 50 bytes for the desctiption) to the executable file size. This is possible because of the way the Linux loader brings the programs into memory. When you build your executable file, the Linux linker adds info to the file describing all the symbols you’ve defined, including symbols naming data items. The loader knows which data items do not have initial values, and it allocates space in momory for them when it brings the executable in from disk. Data items with initial values are read in along with their values.\nThe actual machine instructions that make up your program go into the .text section. The .text section contains symbols called labels that identify locations in the program code for jumps and calls. All global labels must be declared in the .text section, or the labels cannot be “seen” outside your program.\nRefer to compiler,linker,assembler,loader\nLinux Compiler: A compiler is a specialized system tool that translates a program written in a specific programming language into the assembly language code.\nLinux Assembler: The assembler translates our assembly code to the machine code and then stores the result in an object file. Moving further, the assembler gives a memory location to each object and instruction in our code. The memory location can be physical as well as virtual. A virtual location is an offset that is relative to the base address of the first instruction.\nLinux Linker: The linker combines all external programs (such as libraries and other shared components) with our program to create a final executable.\nLinux Loader: The loader is a specialized operating system module. It loads the final executable code into memory.\nLabels must begin with a letter or else with an underscore, period, or question mark. Theese last three have special meanings to the assembler, so don’t use them until you know how NASM interprets them.\nLabels must be followed by a colon when they are defined.\nLabels are case sensitive.\nPUSH: pushes a 16-bit or 64-bit register or memory value that is specified by you in your source code. Note that you can’t push an 8-bit nore a 32-bit value onto the stack! You’ll get an error if you try.\nPUSHFQ: pushes the full 64-bit RFlags register onto the stack. The Q means quadword.\nAny of the 16-bit and 64-bit general-purpose registers may be pushed individually onto the stack. You can’t push AL or BH or any other of the 8-bit registers. 16bit and 64bit immediate data can be pushed onto the stack. User-space Linux programs cannot push the segment registers onto the stack under any circumstance. With x64, segment registers belong to the OS and are unavailable to user-space programs. As odd as it might seem, 32-bit values (including all 32-bit registers) may not be pushed onto the stack.\nPOP\npopfq ; pop 8bytes from the stack into RFlags \npop rcx \npop bx \npop [rbx] \nPUSHA, PUSHAD, POPA, POPAD are gone in x64, though they are available in x86-32. These instructions were used to push or pop all of the general-purpose registers at once. They are removed likely due to that there are a lot more general-purpose registers in x64.\nABI: Application Binary Interface. It defines a collection of fundamental callable functions, generally supplied by the operating system, as is done in Linux. This definition describes how to pass parameters to the many kernel service functions. An ABI also defines how linkers link compiled or assembled modules into a single executable binary program.\nRDI, RSI, RDX, R10,R8,R9 specifies a system call’s parameters. RAX is dedicated to the numeric code specifying the system call to be made.\nThe SYSCALL instruction itself makes use of RAX, RCX, and R11 internally. After the SYSCALL returns, you can’t assume that RAX, RCX or R11 will have the same values they did before the SYSCALL.\nHow to reserve bytes in .bss section in NASM. How to do it in gas?\n;nasm assembly \nsection .bss\nBuff resb 1\n;gas assembly \n.bss \n.lcomm buff1, 10 ;reserve length bytes for a local common denoted by symbol.
